      For this homework assignment you will be creating a simple Angular
      application that simulates an online chat.  This amazing chat program
      will allow two people sitting at the same computer to talk to one
      another as if they were sitting right next to each other!
    </p>
    <p>
      The web page will consist of two <dfn>terminals</dfn>, each containing a
      text box that the user can type messages into.  When the user enters a
      message, it will be added to a <dfn>display</dfn> at the bottom of the
      page.  This display will show all the messages that have been entered,
      from most recent to least recent, each labeled with the name of the user
      who submitted the message.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
      <h1>The amazing chat program</h1>
      <section class="terminals">
        <div>
          <h4>User One</h4>
          <input type="text"/>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>User Two</h4>
          <input type="text"/>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="display">
        <p>
          <span class="user">Two:</span> It's like I'm sitting right next to you!
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="user">Two:</span> I know, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="user">One:</span> This chat program is amazing!
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="user">Two:</span> What's up?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="user">One:</span> Hello
        </p>
      </section>
    </div>

      You should create and run this assignment using the Angular CLI as shown
      in class.  The focus of this program is on creating Angular components
      and sharing information between them.  You must create the following
      components:
    </p>

    <ol class="spaced">
      <li><h4>The Display</h4>
        <p>
          This component will show all the messages that have been typed from
          most recent to least recent.  Each message will be labeled with the user
          who submitted it.  The display component should have an input property
          for the array of messages.  It should not alter the messages.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><h4>The Terminal</h4>
        <p>
          This component will allow <em>one</em> user to enter messages.  It
          consists of a text input labeled with the name of the user.  The
          terminal component should have an input property for the name of the
          user, and an output event that is triggered when the user enters a
          message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because Angular is an opinionated framework, I recommend that you
          do <em>not</em> use a form in the template of this component.
          (Angular has opinions on how forms should be used in an
          application.)  Instead, you may create a button the user can click
          to submit a message, or you may register a handler for the special
          angular event <code>keydown.enter</code> to trigger an event every
          time the user presses the Enter key.
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;input type="text" (keydown.enter)="submitMessage()"/&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          You should <em>not</em> submit an empty message; if the text box is
          empty when the user clicks the button and / or presses the Enter key
          then do nothing.  Any time a message is submitted you should clear
          out the input box so that it is ready for the next message.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><h4>The application component</h4>
        <p>
          This is your root component.  It should contain two terminal
          components (one for user "One" and one for user "Two") and a
          display.
        </p>
        <p>
          This component should be in charge of managing the list of
          messages.  It should create the initial list and give it to the
          display component.  Then, any time one of the terminals fires its
          event indicating a new message has been submitted it should add it
          to the list.  (You may want to use the
          array's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift">unshift</a> method.)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Use CSS to make your components look nice.  You should have at least one
      CSS rule for each component.
    </p>
